The goal in Block Ten is to remove all cards from the deck. It is a really luck dependant game.

Setup:

	Type of Deck : Standard Deck

	Tableau: 9 piles. Each Tableu pile is dealt one card face up.

Rules:

	1) You can remove cards in pairs that add up to ten.

	2) Tens cannot be removed.

	3) Jack, Queens, and Kings are removed in pairs.

	4) Empty slots left by removing pairs are automatically filled by cards from the deck.
